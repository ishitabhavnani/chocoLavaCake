# ChocoLavaCake

Chocolate lava cake  is a popular dessert that combines the elements of a chocolate cake and a soufflé. It has a liquid chocolate center.

Hey there fellow chocolate lover! If there was a dessert that celebrated chocolate in all its glory, its this one. I’m talking about a nice crust on the outside and as you cut into it, there’s flowing melty chocolate that oozes out. This is rich, gooey, soft centered dark chocolate that’s the perfect consistency.
